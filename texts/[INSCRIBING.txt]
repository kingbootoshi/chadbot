[INSCRIBING ORDINALS: HOW TO INSCRIBE?]
## SHOW USERS THIS GUIDE WHEN THEY ASK HOW TO INSCRIBE, WHERE CAN I INSCRIBE, ECT.

How can I inscribe my own files on Ordinals?

How to Inscribe? Want to inscribe yourself? You can inscribe without installing the ord client! 
Inscribing requires the following process:
1. Picking a chrome extension wallet (such as xVerse/Unisat) and loading it up with bitcoin
2. Navigating to an inscription site (such as Unisat or Ordinalsbot, any marketplace and more) and connecting your wallet
3. Follow the site's inscription proccess. Upload the file you want to inscribe, pay the fee and viola. Your file is inscribed on Bitcoin!

Keep in mind, depending on the file some sites may not support it, or your file could be too large to inscribe on Bitcoin. As an ecosystem we are actively working on compressive techniques to allow more art inscribed on Bitcoin!

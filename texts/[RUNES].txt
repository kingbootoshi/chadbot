[RUNES]
Runes are a new fungible token protocol on Bitcoin in development by the Ord team. It will go live the same block as the halvening, which should be somewhere in April.


It is said to be more efficient than BRC-20s, both in transaction time (requires 1 TXN to trade instead of 2) as well as fees (cheaper to interact with!)

Bitmaps are a user made meta-protocol using Ordinal inscriptions as the base. Original minters simply inscribed [BITCOIN_BLOCK_NUMBER.bitmap] (eg. 2.bitmaps, 1002.bitmaps, 810000.bitmaps) before somebody else did to "claim" that bitcoin block as metaversal land.
Imagine owning a piece of digital land. Not just any land, but a unique and irreplaceable slice of the Bitcoin blockchain itself. That's what Bitmaps on Ordinals offers.


Here's the breakdown:


- **Ordinals** make every individual Satoshi on the Bitcoin blockchain identifiable and trackable. They are like digital DNA for your Bitcoin, unique and unreplicable.
- **Bitmaps** use this new feature to create digital real estate. By inscribing a Bitcoin block with a Bitmap—claiming it with "blocknumber.bitmap"—that space is now uniquely yours.
- The draw? As Bitcoin's blockchain grows block by block, so does the potential of Bitmaps—endlessly expandable, mirroring the blockchain's own growth.
- Why the high value? It's because these inscribed blocks are unique. Once a block is claimed, it's off the market, a digital "limited edition."
- Developers see potential here, building on this new digital landscape, turning each block into a metaverse space teeming with possibilities.


Understanding Bitmaps is understanding the frontier of digital ownership and development—a blend of scarcity, technology, and community building on the backbone of Bitcoin.

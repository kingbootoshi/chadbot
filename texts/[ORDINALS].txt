# Ordinal Theory Handbook Compilation

## Introduction to Ordinal Theory
- "What exactly are Ordinals in Bitcoin?"
- "How do Ordinals function within the Bitcoin blockchain?"
- "What is the significance of assigning unique identities to satoshis?"
- "Can you explain the numismatic value of Ordinals?"
- "In what ways are Ordinals secure and immutable?"
Ordinal theory assigns unique identities to Bitcoin's smallest unit, satoshis, enabling their tracking and imbuing them with meaning. It operates on-chain without needing sidechains, tokens, or changes to Bitcoin. Ordinals carry numismatic value, can be inscribed with data, and are as secure as Bitcoin itself. They spawn unique digital artifacts, which are immutable and traceable, opening possibilities for various use-cases.
This enables the creation of "digital artifacts" or "inscriptions" attached to specific satoshis, effectively creating native Bitcoin NFTs.

## Ordinals Overview
- "How are satoshis numbered using Ordinals?"
- "What is the purpose of the ordinal index and how does it work?"
- "Can you explain the transfer rules for Ordinals?"
- "What are some potential use-cases for Ordinals?"
Ordinals are a numbering scheme for satoshis based on their mining order, transferable by specific rules without the need for additional tokens or blockchain changes. They can represent various assets and are open-source, with an index for tracking, a wallet for transactions, and a block explorer.

## Rarity and Naming
- "How is rarity determined in the context of Ordinals?"
- "What does the base-26 encoding system for naming Ordinals entail?"
- "Can you give examples of rare Ordinals and how they're categorized?"
Rarity in ordinals is dictated by Bitcoin's periodic events (blocks, difficulty adjustments, halvings, and cycles), and ordinals can be named using a base-26 encoding. Rare ordinals are prized and can be tagged as common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, or mythic based on their mining time and events.


## Inscriptions
- "What does inscribing content onto a satoshi mean?"
- "How secure is the inscription process?"
- "What information is included in an inscription's metadata?"
- "How are inscriptions uniquely identified?"
Satoshis can have arbitrary content inscribed, creating Bitcoin-native digital artifacts. This process involves a commit/reveal transaction structure and is securely stored on-chain. Inscriptions include fields like content type, pointer, parent, metadata, and content encoding. They are identified by a unique ID involving the transaction ID and index.


## Digital Artifacts and Ownership
- "What are digital artifacts in the Ordinals ecosystem?"
- "How does ownership of a digital artifact work?"
- "Can digital artifacts be traded or transferred?"
Digital artifacts are complete, immutable, permissionless, uncensorable, and have owners. They are conceptually parallel to physical artifacts but exist in the digital realm and are guaranteed by the Bitcoin blockchain.


## Ordinals and NFT Comparison
- "How are Ordinals different from Ethereum NFTs?"
- "Why might Ordinals be considered more secure than NFTs?"
- "What does it mean that Ordinals have a richer content model?"
Ordinals differ from Ethereum NFTs in that they are always on-chain and immutable, simpler, more secure, scarce, and do not support on-chain royalties. They can attract new markets due to Bitcoin's broader appeal and have a richer content model.


## Collecting Ordinals
- "What should collectors know about handling Ordinals?"
- "Which wallets are recommended for collecting Ordinals and why?"
Collecting ordinals requires careful handling as they are tied to individual satoshis. Wallets must support sat-control and sat-selection to safely store and transfer ordinals and inscriptions. It's advisable to use wallets like ord that automatically handle these requirements.


## Sending and Receiving Ordinals
- "How do I safely send an Ordinal to someone else?"
- "What precautions should I take when receiving an Ordinal?"
To safely send and receive ordinals, use Bitcoin Core wallets or wallets like Sparrow that allow UTXO control, ensuring that each transaction selects the correct UTXO containing the desired ordinal. Always verify the details before executing a transaction to prevent loss of ordinals.


## Moderation of Ordinal Content
- "How can I moderate the content of Ordinals displayed on my block explorer?"
- "What are the best practices for content moderation in the Ordinals ecosystem?"
Operators of ordinal block explorers should moderate content to prevent the display of objectionable or unlawful material. This can be done using configuration files to hide specific inscriptions and is the responsibility of the individual running the instance.


## Reindexing and Bounty Hunting
- "What does reindexing the ord database involve?"
- "How does bounty hunting for Ordinals work?"
Occasionally, the ord database must be reindexed, particularly after major updates or database corruption. Bounty hunting for ordinals can be a challenging task, with rewards offered for fulfilling specific criteria related to ordinal numbers or inscriptions.

For detailed guidance and technical instructions related to ordinals, refer to the official documentation and GitHub repository.


## Reinscription
- "Can a single satoshi have multiple inscriptions?"
- "How does reinscription add value to an Ordinal?"
Reinscription refers to the process of adding multiple inscriptions to a single satoshi. While individual inscriptions are immutable, a satoshi can accumulate several inscriptions, adding layers to its history and value.


## Inscription Numbers and Collectibility
- "Why are early inscription numbers considered more valuable?"
- "How does the inscription number influence collectibility?"
Ordinal inscriptions are indexed sequentially, with early numbers indicating rarity and historical significance. Collectors form communities around these numbers, creating a tiered system of value and rarity. Inscription numbers, combined with other factors like file size and type, contribute to an inscription's worth.


## File Size
- "Does the file size of an inscription affect its rarity or value?"
- "What are 'Four Meggers' and why are they significant?"
The file size of an inscription impacts its collectibility. Large inscriptions, known as "Four Meggers," are rare and expensive due to the cost of inscribing and the technical challenge of fitting within Bitcoin's transaction size limits.


## File Type
- "What types of files can be inscribed as Ordinals?"
- "How are artists using different file types to create Ordinal art?"
Inscriptions aren't limited to images; they can include various file types like videos, gifs, audio, games, and 3D objects. Artists explore this versatility to push the boundaries of on-chain art.


## Bitmaps
- "What is the concept of Bitmaps in the Ordinals protocol?"

Bitcoin Boos: 
Bitcoin Boos is a collection of 101 unique characters named 'Boos', which are cute. 48x48 pixel characters that vary in species, such as dragon, dog, god, humanoid, etc. Boos live in the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Their home is on Block 775087 and they live in the grand, elegant civilization named "The Boo Kingdom" The very first Boo to be inscribed is the Boo King, Bootoshi, on Block 775087. Each boo is super strong and each one is an important contributor to the kingdom. The Boos are immortal, so while they can die they simply just respawn back at home base as if nothing has happened. They also have a collection of 35 uncommons sats inscribed in the sub 200 uncommon range called the ‘Boottalion’

Punk Wars was a race to be the first punks collection on bitcoin between Ordinal Punks and Punks on Bitcoin. Punks on Bitcoin inscribed the first digital artifact of their 100-piece collection at inscription #406 beating Ordinal Punks by 1 space as the first Ordinal Punk was inscribed at #407. Ordinal Punks ultimately won out as the entire collection was inscribed first and in the first 1,000 inscriptions. Punks on Bitcoin suffered an unfortunate setback as a number of the original inscriptions were sent to a Binance address which forced Punktoshi to reinscribe the lost pieces.
